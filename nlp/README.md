- [12_text](12_text.ipynb): Preprocessing Text via Tokenization and Numericalization from scratch. Learnt how to batch nlp data for classfication purposes.
- [12a_awd_lstm](12a_awd_lstm.ipynb): Built the AWD-LSTM model
- [12b_lm_pretrain](12b_lm_pretrain.ipynb): Pretrain the Language model on Wikitext103 dataset.
- [12c_ulmfit](12c_ulmfit.ipynb): Finetuning the Language model on the IMDB corpus, how to deal with padding; Copy the weights of the encoder of the language model and attach it to a new head followed by applying transfer learning and training the model to classify IMDB reviews. Achieved close to state of the art accuracy(92.8%).
